== Documentation Samples

The documents folder contains sample documentation and links to additional examples 
on MDN Web Docs.

    * **modal** - A step-by-step tutorial that shows how to create and display
    a modal dialog box over the web page. The tutorial is in index.html.

    * **BeginningWebDevelopment** - is a Microsoft Word document that (in this
    repo) disccuses the parts of an HTML page. The articles were written early
    this year as part of a potential book on web development. Thereis also a PDF
    copy of the document.

    * **[How to Search](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Search)** - An article on MDN Web Docs that describes the search capabilities of the Firefox JavaScript Debugger. As of July 30, 2020, the page lists me as the last to edit it on October 15, 2019.

    * **[Element: mousedown event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event)** - is an MDN Web Docs page describing the event handler for the mousedown event. The reference was written as part of an initiative to document all event handlers.

The page describes the mousedown event and the accompanying JavaScript example
uses the mousedown, musemove, and mouseup event handlers to let the reader draw
using the mouse. To keep the example simple, it only draws. There is no eraser
and no ability to change the drawing color or the pen thickness.

=== Document History
    
    ![Screenshot of Document History](./documents/mousedown_event_history.jpg)

== SnipMan

This is a Python application that I created back in 2012 to track the tasks and
projects I was working on while I was a contractor at Google. Employees were
required to submit a list of the tasks they completed during the week. This app
allowed me to create the file as I was working on it during the week. It helped
me to remember what I had worked on so I could report it accurately.

== Stuff2Do

The web app Stuff2Do is a jQuery example that manages a simple To Do list. Tasks
are stored in local storage rather than in a database just to keep the
application simple. It was written as a learning exercise.

== WhatToDo

What to do is similar to Stuff2Do. It is a C# Windows Desktop application that
maintains a list of tasks. In this case, tasks are stored in a text file. on
the user's computer.

TIP: I did not create an installer for this application. You must copy the code
to your computer and compile it yourself.
